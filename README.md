# Finesse Writing + AI Project

Project Team:

We have created a tool that looks at your writing, picks out imperfect word choice, and makes suggestions. We take a dataset of great writing, look at its tf_idf words, and only suggest from those. This tool is useful for editing your 4th draft or finding the perfect word. It’s an improvement over a thesaurus because it’s context dependent and fasttext trained. 

We also hope it can be a foundation for other word-recommendation tools that can check for racial and gender biased language or make other more tailored writing suggestions.

Our principles are speed, effectiveness, and creative choice.
