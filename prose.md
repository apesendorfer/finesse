Tokarczuk <span id="demo" class="spelling-error" onmouseover="foo(this)">defines</span>
 the book’s ambiguous and fluid nature in the few first pages, developing a narrator with a yearning for the past, present, and future. 


---

The novel begins from the perspective of a child who says, “I’m a few years old” (Tokarczuk 1). 

---

While most child narrators in literature speak in the present tense and offer unique insight — often beyond the scope of what one would expect from a child — Tokarczuk’s narrator is different. 

---

The narrator does speak from the perspective of their childhood self, and they do so in the present tense, but with the knowledge of what the future holds. 

---

This is made clear by this sentence that follows the child’s description of a dark, frightening night: “That evening is the limit of the world, and I’ve just happened upon it, by accident, while playing, not in search of anything” (2).

---

By writing “That evening is”, and not writing either “This evening is” to indicate that night is still going or “That evening was” to indicate the night has passed, the narrator positions herself between time, imbuing a moment from her childhood with knowledge from the present.

This entanglement and ambiguity is carried on in more extreme forms throughout the text.
